            <p>I'm a strong believer in helping out the individuals who come after me and was able to do so through serving as President for Women in Computer Science. I also helped launch SparkHacks; UIC's own hackathon and served as Co-Director.</p>
            <p>I love watching movies, exploring Chicago, rating experiences and reading!</p>
