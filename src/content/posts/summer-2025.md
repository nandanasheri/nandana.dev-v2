This is my first summer where I don't have a calendar created by an external entity. And honestly that was very frightening in the beginning. This might be a bad habit but I don't really believe in a 3 month vacation after I completed my Bachelors Degree, mainly because 
- I cannot afford that in this job market. 
- I *literally* cannot afford that and 
- I have no real 'plans' for my future set in place (like a job lined up) to not be anxious over

But I am also deathly afraid that summer is going to fly by and I would have done nothing of meaning or importance. So here is a list of things I hope to work towards this summer. Some may be quantified, others may not. May be I can come back to this on August 24th with an update? 

### I really hope this goes better than my new years resolutions..

- ~~leetcode consistently (150 problems? or i am shooting myself in the foot)~~ (i hit 130 good enough)
- ~~resume revamp + seek feedback~~ + job applications 
- ~~real mock interviews with strangers~~ (imo, hardest todo)
- ~~tinker with ML models in the form of a project~~ (or 2)
- ~~deploy a server based app~~
- ~~consistency w the rec~~ (3x + walks)
- ~~crochet something for someone~~
- read minimum 3 books
- ~~trip to nyc~~
- DL (this is a big stretch)

Maybe I should aim lower, be more realistic but I'm so used to being overly ambitious and not meeting them all *yet*, I usually end up fairly satisfied with the result because something is better than nothing!

To anyone else out there who doesn't have a 9-5 this summer and is struggling to hold themselves accountable, scheduling my calendar out like I have a real job has helped a lot in terms of being productive because I am blocking out time just like I would on a job.

Fairly excited to see where this summer leads me !
