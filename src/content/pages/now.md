- Summer has been going by pretty quickly.
- I'm working on [Radiology Report Generation](https://github.com/nandanasheri/radiology-report-gen) with Multimodal LLM Inference under Dr. Sweta Yadav at UIC. 
- This is my fourth week of consistently practising [Leetcode Problems](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HTn7J20fcf9rRZSqBZEAsUUteruPn25UpufvegiZpo/edit?usp=sharing).
- I'm working on a small side project to get myself familiarized with pretrained models being used within an app's backend.
- I'm hosting a [Workshop](https://github.com/wics-uic/pixel-perfect-tutorial) on Intro to React for highschool students at GirlCon 2025, Chicago.
- I'm wrapping up Tuesdays with Morrie - looking forward to starting up Notes of a Crocodile!
